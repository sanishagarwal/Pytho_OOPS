    "*The FIVE key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Class and Object:       \n",
    "        A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of that class. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have. Objects represent real-world entities and are created based on the structure outlined in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Encapsulation:     \n",
    "    Encapsulation refers to bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit, typically a class, and restricting access to the internal workings of that object. By controlling access to certain parts, encapsulation protects an object's integrity and ensures that data is used in a controlled manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance:      \n",
    "    Inheritance allows one class (called a subclass or child class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (called a superclass or parent class). This promotes code reuse and creates a natural hierarchy between classes, reducing redundancy and making the code more modular.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism:           \n",
    "    Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to respond to the same method in their own unique way. It allows for flexibility and scalability in code, as the same operation can be performed differently depending on the object type. This is typically achieved through method overriding or method overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Abstraction:             \n",
    "    Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. By simplifying interactions and focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it, abstraction reduces complexity and makes the system easier to use and maintain."

    "*The Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python is the order in which a class's methods are searched when invoking a method. When a method is called on an instance of a class, Python follows the MRO to determine the sequence in which it looks for that method in the class hierarchy.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The MRO is particularly important in cases of multiple inheritance, where a class inherits from more than one parent class. Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm (also known as the C3 superclass linearization) to compute the MRO in such cases, ensuring that the inheritance structure is followed consistently.*\n",
